This repository is used for learning, examples, and demonstrations.
It may not make sense to everybody, the ideas and principles are not all mine, but picked up and adapted from a variety of sources.
I use the ideas here to implement within a psuedo-application, something that is likely to exist in any company anywhere.

I find that testing and playing with ideas within a working application to be easier to understand and properly implement in an Enterprise-style application.
